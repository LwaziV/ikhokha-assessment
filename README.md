# Basic usage
=> I have created a basic UI for users/customers to be able to create reviews and comments.
=> Only after this information has been provided then the internal team is able to click on view report which will then display the report through the console and also downloads the .txt file to your local machine for better visual.
=> "'SHAKER' reviews : 0 " Indicates the total number of reviews with the Shaker machine review
=> "'MOVER' reviews : 0 " Indicates the total number of reviews with the Mover machine review
=> The number at the top right on the toolbar indicates the total number of reviews on the latest saved document
