# ikhokha-assessment
IKTribe application to analyze customer online reviews, comments and generate a report for BI

# Framework Used
Angular with typescript
Node.js
## Getting Started

1. Install the angular [CLI](https://cli.angular.io) by running `npm install -g @angular/cli`
2. Clone the repo from (https://github.com/LwaziV/ikhokha-assessment) 
3. Install project dependencies by running `npm install`
4. Start dev server `npm start`

# Basic Usage
=> Currently the application does not have any reviews nor comments, so the report is expected to be empty when trying to generate.
=> I have created a basic UI for users/customers to be able to create reviews and comments.
=> Only after this information has been provided then the internal team is able to click on generate report which will then create the report with all the required information and displayed through the console.
=> I have made different options for viewing the report that is user-friendly and easy to understand, thus exporting to a pdf/csv file
